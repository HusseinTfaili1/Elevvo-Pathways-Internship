Titanic Survival Analysis – Level 1 Task 2

This project investigates the well-known Titanic dataset to identify survival patterns among passengers using Python. This analysis covers data cleaning, feature engineering, descriptive statistics, and visualizations.

// Make sure you have "train.xlsx" in the SAME FOLDER as the Python script. //

Dataset
Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuofxz/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster) using the train file.

1. Data Loading & Cleaning

* Loaded the Titanic training dataset into a pandas DataFrame
* Fills missing values in the Age column with the median and in the Embarked column with the most frequent port.

2. Feature Engineering

* Converts (Sex, Pclass, and Embarked) into categorical variables
* Extracts passenger Title from the Name column and groups rare titles
* Calculates FamilySize and categorizes it into FamilyGroup: Single, Small, Large
* Adds a HasCabin feature: 1 if a cabin is listed, 0 if not; keeps the original Cabin column
* Creates a Fare\_display column showing fare values with a GBP (£) symbol

3. Summary Statistics & Group Insights

* Prints descriptive statistics for both numeric and all columns
* Calculates and displays survival rates grouped by:

  * Sex
  * Passenger Class
  * Embarkation Port
  * Title
  * Family Group

4. Visualizations

* Bar charts showing survival rates by:

  * Sex
  * Passenger Class
  * Embarkation Port
  * Family Group
  * Title
  * Combined Sex and Class (grouped bar plot)

* Correlation heatmap for numeric features
