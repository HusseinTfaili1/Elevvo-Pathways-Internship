Data Analytics Track Internship

Welcome to my Data Analytics Track Internship repository. 
This repo contains all tasks and supporting files completed as part of the internship, focused on building core skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using tools like Excel, python, sql and more.



The internship is divided into 3 levels, each containing one or more tasks. Each task includes:

Excel files: Raw and cleaned datasets.

Text or Markdown documents: Task explanations, step-by-step notes, insights

Code Files: code with explanation


Thank you to Elevvo Pathways for this opportunity.
Iâ€™ll be updating this repository as I complete each level and will share the GitHub link on LinkedIn.
