1) Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and handling missing or inconsistent data.

2) Applied label encoding and mappings to transform categorical variables into a usable format for analysis.

3) Explored respondent preferences such as favorite programming languages, most used tools, and job titles.

4) Generated insights on trends in the data science community based on survey responses.

5) Visualized the top 5 insights using charts and summarized them in a simple dashboard.
